# AI-1 HW2: Regression Modelling of bacteria growth
Homework group members: Akash Reddy, Karthik Balaji.

In this homework, we mainly explored polynomial regression for predicting a quantitative variable. Specifically, we built regression models that can predict the percentage change in bacteria population after 4 hours based on their spreading factor. These prediction models can be useful in clustering of a novel bacteria to any class.
